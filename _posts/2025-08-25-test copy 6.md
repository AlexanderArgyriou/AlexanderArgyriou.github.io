# Understanding Java Reflection: A Deep Dive  

Java is a strongly typed language, meaning type information is usually known at compile-time. However, there are times when you might want to inspect or modify classes, methods, fields, or constructors at runtime. This is where **Reflection** comes in.  

Reflection is part of the `java.lang.reflect` package and the `Class` API. It allows developers to **analyze, modify, and interact with the internal properties of classes and objects dynamically**.

## üìå What is Reflection?  

**Reflection** in Java is the ability of a program to examine and manipulate the structure and behavior of objects at runtime.  

For example, you can:  
- Get the **name of a class** at runtime.  
- Inspect **methods, fields, and constructors** dynamically.  
- Create objects without knowing their class at compile time.  
- Invoke methods dynamically.  
- Modify access levels (e.g., access `private` fields/methods).

## ‚öôÔ∏è When to Use Reflection?  

Reflection is useful in many scenarios, such as:  

1. **Framework Development**  
   - Dependency injection frameworks like Spring and Guice use Reflection to create and inject objects dynamically.  

2. **Testing Tools**  
   - JUnit uses Reflection to invoke test methods annotated with `@Test`.  

3. **Serialization / Deserialization**  
   - Libraries like Jackson and Gson use Reflection to convert objects to and from JSON.  

4. **IDE & Debugging Tools**  
   - Tools like IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse use Reflection for runtime analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Reflection in Action: Examples  

### 1. Getting Class Information  

```java
class Person {
    private String name;
    public int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    private void showDetails() {
        System.out.println(name + " is " + age + " years old.");
    }
}
```

```java
public class ReflectionDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Class<?> clazz = Class.forName("Person");

        System.out.println("Class Name: " + clazz.getName());
        System.out.println("Superclass: " + clazz.getSuperclass());
        
        System.out.println("\nFields:");
        for (var field : clazz.getDeclaredFields()) {
            System.out.println(field.getName() + " : " + field.getType());
        }

        System.out.println("\nMethods:");
        for (var method : clazz.getDeclaredMethods()) {
            System.out.println(method.getName());
        }
    }
}
```
